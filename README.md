Hello everyone,

This repository contains nine examples of Spring Security.

* Default Behavior (Chapter_One)
* Create Custom User Detail Service (Chapter_Two)
* Using Different Approaches (Chapter_Three)
* Custom Authentication Provider (Chapter_Four)
* CORS and CSRF Configuration (Chapter_Five)
* Adding Role or Authority for a Specific Path (Chapter_Six)
* Creating a Custom Filter (Chapter_Seven)
* JWT (Json Web Token) and Method Level Security (Chapter_Eight)

Additionally, database connection is required for some examples. There is a docker-compose file in this repository. 
You can use the docker-compose directly (docker compose up). Then, these examples include the db_script.sql file in the resources folder for each example.
You can run the script before running the application. 
Note: All examples work on port 9090, you can configure the port in the application.yml file.
